## Description
I found 3 ideas for this variation jam: I'm starting from the frogfrogfrog game

1. game: STARFISH SNATCHER
Underwater ocean environment and play as an octopus whose tentacle shoots out to grab treasures

2. ALIEN LASER 
You are an alien UFO hovering above a planet using a tractor beam instead of a tongue

3. FRUIT SLASH
You are a samurai slicing falling fruit with your katana (just like fruit ninja)
This description should help the reader understand what the program is, anything they should know to be able to experience it (controls, special features, etc.), and what the desired user experience is. For example:

> *The Mayor of Clown Town* is a simulator experience that allows the user to control a small town populated entirely by clowns.

> The experience is controlled via the mouse, with left click selecting a clown and bringing up a menu of options such as "slip of banana peel" or "get into impossible capacious clown-car."

> The project is meant to give the user a sense of what it would be the mayor of a town of clowns, eventually getting the sense that clowns are not taking their civic duties seriously.

## Screenshot(s)

This bit should have some images of the program running so that the reader has a sense of what it looks like. For example:
