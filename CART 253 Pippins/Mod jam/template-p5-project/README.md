## Description

 * A game of catching flies with your frog-tongue
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * - Move the frog with your mouse
 * - Click to launch the tongue
 * - Catch flies
 Basically you must avoid to eat the red flies which deduce 2 points from your score board and make you transparent, 
 yellow flies give you additional points and temporarily makes you yellow
 Normal black flies are more frequents, they give you a point each
 the level 1 game lasts a minute, level two is supposed to last 50 seconds, levle 3, 40 secs. 
 Try to have the highest score possible

 I wanted to add more images or sounds but each time i tried to implement them the game either froze or just wouldn't load, I still don't know why
