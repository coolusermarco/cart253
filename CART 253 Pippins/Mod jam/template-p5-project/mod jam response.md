when i first tested his mod jam project i kinda told myself like wait this is actually really fun and it somehow looks like the original template but also doesnt look like it at all. it still has that familiar base the sky the frog the whole setup but the way he changed certain elements made it feel more like a remix instead of just a tiny tweak. its like the original game is still underneath everything but now it has this new personality layered on top.

the first thing that really caught my attention was how he changed the flies. instead of sliding across the screen in a straight line with that lil sine wave thing from the template he added this zig zag movement and even gave them wings and eyes that move on their own. it made the whole thing way more cartoonish and energetic. i actually found myself staring at the flies for a sec because they were so goofy looking in the best way. those tiny details made the game feel more alive like the flies were actual characters instead of just targets for the tongue.

one thing i noticed tho is that some of the ideas from his idea file didnt make it into the final version like the good fly bad fly idea or the flyflyfly mode where you control the fly. kinda unfortunate because those ideas sounded super fun and i was curious how he wouldve made them work. but honestly even without those features i still really liked what he did add. sometimes keeping it simple works better and it really felt like he focused on polishing the things he wanted instead of throwing everything in.

the timer was probably one of my fav changes. instead of putting it in the corner like i did he put it right in the back big and centered. its such a small choice but it changed the whole feel of the game. seeing the timer behind everything made me feel this lil pressure like the game was whispering bro hurry up. it made the whole thing more intense and honestly funnier too.

im also pretty impressed he managed to layer audio. when i tried adding buzzing sounds AND music my game literally refused to load and everything broke. so the fact he got multiple sounds working at the same time is actually really impressive. sound in p5 can be a pain so props to huynh for figuring that out.

overall i think his mod jam project is simple but really cool. the little twists he added made it feel fresh even if not all his ideas made it in. what he did add works super well. seriously props to him great job.

when i first tried his mod jam honestly the first thing that came out of my mouth was like bro what is happening in this swamp right now in the best way possible. i opened it expecting a kinda simple frog catches flies thing like the template but the whole thing feels way more dramatic and chaotic and honestly kind of funny. the title screen already sets the tone the giant neon green frog staring at me with those big pupils following my mouse around made me laugh before i even started. and the whole “swamp of eden” vibe is surprisingly serious sounding for a game where the frog basically starves or gets swarmed lol

once i clicked to start the game it switched completely. no cursor anymore and immediately flies just start spawning and moving in this really smooth sinusoidal pattern. it’s not just one or two flies either he actually uses an array and just keeps pushing new flies every time one goes off screen so the population can get wild really fast. and it does. i hit a point where there were honestly like a literal cloud of names and dots all over my screen and i was like yeah ok this frog is done for. i saw the code where he does this thing like 
fly = createFly(random(3, 4), random(names))
flies.push(fly)
and i didnt think much of it until i played and suddenly there's like 200 “baby fly traveller fly evolved fly” labels flying at me all at once. it’s ridiculous but in a good way it makes the gameplay feel kinda frantic like you’re fighting a losing battle to keep this ecosystem balanced

i also really liked how he made the frog move differently from the template. instead of using the mouse he switched everything to keyboard arrows which honestly gives it a whole different feel. felt more like an old school arcade kinda thing and the frog becomes more of an actual character instead of just following your cursor. plus the tongue being controlled with the spacebar makes the timing feel way more important. i kept messing it up but that’s on me lol

the whole win lose system is also super funny because it’s basically like either you starve because you didnt catch enough flies or you get completely overwhelmed by a swarm when the flies get over 200. i love the melodrama of the game over screens too like the background literally fades to black for the starving ending it’s so dramatic for a frog game i couldnt stop laughing. also the fact that the eyes look at the closest fly using that little “flyWatch” function was such a nice touch makes the frog look kinda stressed out all the time

the menu alone was really polished too the little instructions the big frog taking over the whole screen the keyboard icons all of that made it feel super playful. so yeah overall his mod jam was actually kinda impressive and chaotic in a fun way the population system the multiple endings the fly variety the keyboard movement all those lil code additions made it feel like its own game totally separate from the template. really cool stuff honestly nice job to philippe for going all out on this one.

when i opened her mod jam again and really paid attention to everything i realized how unhinged but also genuinely funny the whole thing is. the title screen already had me giggling but the second the game starts the first thing that hit me was the background music. it sounds exactly like those old og roblox game tracks from like 2010 the ones that were kinda goofy and cheerful but also weirdly nostalgic. the vibe fits so perfectly with the chaotic frog world she made it honestly boosts the whole energy of the game because it makes everything feel silly in the best way.

the gameplay still goes wild in all the ways i mentioned before but knowing that the music is looping under all of this makes it feel like some lost roblox minigame where you catch flies for tickets or something. and then on top of that there are minecraft sound effects in here too. the little mlem noise when you eat a fly kinda sounds like the minecraft eating sound and when you get hit by the horsefly the hurt sound legit reminded me of minecraft damage audio. with the roblox music and the minecraft sounds together it feels like my childhood got blended into a frog themed smoothie.

and the video lmaooo, i dont know if ppl would get the reference but a dude randomly popping up every 16 seconds is actually joji which makes it so much funnier. like youre playing this frog game everything is normalish and then joji appears in the middle of the lake doing the weird run dance from that old filthy frank era clip. it literally jumpscares you because it just shows up wherever it wants. i still cant believe she coded the video to appear randomly all over the screen it is so unserious but so entertaining.

all the other stuff she added still goes crazy too like the friend frogs watching you with their googly eyes the horsefly going feral with the rageLevel shaking the confetti explosion whenever you hit a milestone the frog growing bigger every time you eat something the pepe screaming on the game over screen all of it stacked together makes the game feel like one long meme that somehow became fully playable.

the combination of features she added makes her mod jam feel like a mashup of frog simulator roblox obby minecraft chaos pepe meme and joji jumpscare all happening at the same time. honestly its such a weird mix but it works because the whole game leans into the goofy energy so hard. the OG template is still kinda there under it all but she piled so much personality and randomness on top that it feels like its own standalone fever dream of a game.

super creative super chaotic super funny for real she did great on this.
