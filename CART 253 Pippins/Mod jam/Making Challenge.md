1. Frog turns invisible for a few seconds after eating a fly
Fade frog out briefly
I gotta make sure collisions still work

2. Flies move in zig-zag or random patterns
Add wavy or random movement
Issue is to keep it readable

3. The tongue is a grappling hook
Pull frog upward when tongue hits something
Movement could get messy so I need to think about this in depth  

4. Add multiple flies on screen at once  
I could just maybe use a random for the amount of flies per second?
Or maybe there's other solutions


5. The world tilts when you move  
Slight canvas rotation when frog moves
It'll be complicated not to overdo it, i gotta be careful with the %

6. Flies can dodge the frog’s tongue sometimes 
Random quick movement when tongue gets close
The tongue is already fast so I doubt it'll be possible 

7. Add a timer
Countdown for the time-based score 
It has to reset properly, if I can't then the player will have to refresh the page lol

8. Special fly that gives extra points  
Golden fly worth more?
Issue is to make it stand out

9. Point system
Add score variable and display
The scoring might get messy with the other ideas I have to reduce score, add bonusses

10. Add background music and sound effects for tongue and fly  
Play sounds on catch or tongue use
Avoid repetition and loop, if possible

11. Random events that happen (fog, rain, sound effects)
Trigger effects occasionally
Don’t distract too much

12. Special items that the frog can eat
Random bonus items in the sky
Differentiate from flies, maybe with images?

13. Special items give abilities to the frog
Power-ups like speed or score boost
Time the effects well, careful to not make it last too long or too short

14. Some flies of a distinct color removes points
Red or blue flies are bad
I'll have to make them easy to see

15. Add eyes
Simple white circles with pupils
Place them cleanly and make them follow the frog as it moves

16. Eyes follow the cursor
Pupils track mouse movement
Keep subtle

17. Frog dodges items
Add falling obstacles
Avoid too many at once, i was thinking of another random function but idk yet

18. Every missed tongue shot makes the frog shrink  
Reduce body size on miss
Don’t shrink forever

19. The tongue sticks to clouds and pulls them down
Clouds move when hit
Sync movement smoothly  

20. Cooldown if frog misses too much
Delay before shooting again like 1 or 2 secs
I'll have to indicate cooldown clearly
